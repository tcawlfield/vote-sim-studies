# Plurality voting

Plurality voting is the most common voting system used today. I'll explain it
here, but you already know how it works. You might not have a *name* for it yet.
I'm calling this [Plurality](https://ballotpedia.org/Plurality_voting_system),
but other names are used such as first-past-the-post.

In Plurality voting, voters mark one candidate on their ballot. Once all ballots
are collected, counters add up the numbers of ballots that "vote for" each
candidate. The candidate with the most votes wins the election.

Yes, people often gripe about this method. I do, too. The one thing every
electionologist agrees on is that *Plurality is bad*. But what does that mean?
How bad is it, and in what ways?

Other articles here will go into more details. But here are some highlights:

* Plurality is one of *very many* possible voting methods. It is not the only
  way to vote on things.
  
* Plurality is significantly worse than nearly all other voting methds, and by every measure...

* **Except** when there are exactly **two** choices to consider: a two-candidate
  ballot. A Yea-or-Nay vote. If you have only two choices, almost all voting
  methods give the same result as Plurality. They all become equally good.

* There are two *major* defects with Plurality:
  * A spoiler effect --- when a relatively unpopular candidate is on the ballot
    along with a more popular candidate that shares similar positions and attracts
    some of the same voters, both of those candidates have a harder time getting
    elected. Independent candidates hurt their own causes.
  * A center-squeeze effect --- Plurality rewards candidates toward the fringes
    of a political spectrum, so to speak. Candidates do unreasonably well whose
    supporters are unlikely to pick anyone else on even a crowded ballot.

* Plurality voting, *over time in politics*, leads to:
  * A two-party system. This is [Duverger's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s_law).
    The spoiler effect tends to stunt the growth of third-party movements. I'm not
    saying that Plurality is the *only* reason for two-party systems where they
    occur, but it's an important contributing factor.
  * Divisive representation. The center-squeeze effect makes it difficult for
    centrists to get elected. In US politics, this is particularly severe in
    primary elections.

## What methods are ~~better~~ worse than Plurality?

Of all the voting methods I'm aware of, only one method does worse when stakes
are high: Borda. For well-known reasons, people don't use or recommend Borda. So
just ignore that or other hypothetical voting methods like anti-plurality (the
winner has the fewest dislikes).

To get better election results, all you have to do is use *a different* method!

That said, the second-most-popular voting method, which again goes by many
names, is only marginally better than Plurality. I see no reason to go to the
trouble of replacing the worst voting method with the second-worst: Instant
runoff. There are many great choices of methods! Pick any one! But not Plurality
or Instant runoff. I'm quickly getting off-topic now, but *Bottom-Two* Instant
Runoff is a big improvement over IRV in every way.

# What is voting?

Voting is a poll, but with teeth. Not only does preference information
get collected from people, there is an automatic method of turning that
information into an outcome. Voting is a form of group decision-making.

This feels immediately political, but it is not necessarily. Book clubs might
vote on what book to read next. A group of friends might vote on what movie to
see together. In a bake-off, people will vote for their favotite dish, with the
winner getting a prize. Combining the poll with the outcome makes this a vote.
A motion gets passed, an office gets filled, a movie gets watched, or a baker
gets a prize.

A voting method needs two things:

* A ballot -- what information can voters provide?
* An algorithm -- how to combine all the ballots and find a winner.

We usually assume that voting is egalitarian. All voters have an equal voice.
That does not mean "one person, one vote." It means "one person, one ballot."

Most of the voting methods I'm writing about here are single-winner methods. But
there are many occasions where a multi-winner method is needed. So yes, that's a
thing. I have questions, some ideas, and never enough time.

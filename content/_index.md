Welcome to my blog on voting methods. This has been a hobby of mine for many
years. [What is voting?](reference).

Voting methods are a subject of mathematics. If you want to understand them
better, you need to approach it from that point of view.

I have found that the performance of different voting systems is often
counter-intuitive. It helps to use a voting simulation.
